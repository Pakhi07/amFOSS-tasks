# Introspection
# 1. Why must we choose you?

The prestigious AMFOSS club is filled with the brilliant minds in our college which manage the club so efficiently. If given a chance, I would work towards 
the betterment of the club and contribute as much as I can. I have been programming since 9th standard, where I started using Java. I switched schools in 11th 
and we weren't offered computers as a subject in that school so I moved on to learn the basics in Python and C++ myself. I am very hardworking and dedicated. 
I always try to give my best in whatever I do. I am an eager learner and I feel like the club would introduce me to many more fun and exciting opportunities.

# 2. What is your plan for the next 6 months?

In the next 6 months, I wish to improve my coding skills and start working on some development fields. In college you get introduced to a lot of new things, 
some of which you never heard of. I wish to have a similar experience and widen my knowledge. I plan on growing both academically and as a person, be more confident, 
and explore new, creative ideas.

# 3. How would you contribute back to the club? 

I would work sincerely on every task allotted to me and help out my colleagues as much as I can. I would take active participation in the events and work towards 
the betterment of the club.

# 4. Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

The selection process was definitely challenging but on working hard enough I was able to get through it, and I guess that's what makes the club exclusive so 
that only those students get in who are very much interested and determined. After completing the tasks I feel more confident in my programming skills and 
after solving all these tasks one wouldn't be a total newbie and would get an idea of what the club actually demands from us.
